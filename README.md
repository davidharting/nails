# Nails ðŸ’…

Attempting to create a Rails-like experience with Next.js. Very similar goals to Blitz.js.

I will attempt to do these things:

- Scaffold out some directories like models, workers, and views
- Create models using Sequelize
- SSR-only pages by using Sequelize to directly query for models
- Create views for each "resource" in a style similar to Rails
- Add authentication with Passport
- Create a "middleware" to be used by `getServerSideProps` that returns `currentUser` similar to devise
- Statically render a marketing page that has a link to sign-in
- If you visit app pages and you are not authenticated, get kicked to login automatically
- Allow to POST by implementing a custom server that processes the post request
  - On error, redirect back to the form page with errors passed in as props
  - On success, redirect to the appropriate page (context dependent)
- Add a solution for asynchronous tasks, probably using Bull

I should probably end up with these directories:

- pages
- models
- jobs
- views (Each subdirectory would be a resource)
- elements (for design-system components)
- helpers (maybe) (somewhere to put logic that is used inside views)
- services (maybe) (for complicated usage of models)
